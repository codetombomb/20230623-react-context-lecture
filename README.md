- **Letâ€™s check out the code example in 01-prop-drilling**

- It works - what's the problem? ðŸ¤·
    - **Complex and verbose**:
        - Prop drilling means passing data through multiple components.
        - This can make the code more complicated and harder to read.
    - **Code maintenance and refactoring**:
        - you have to update all the intermediate components in between.
        - This makes it harder to change or improve the code later on.
    - **Prop pollution**:
        - Components receive data they don't actually need.
        - This can make the code messy and confusing.
    - **Increased development effort**:
        - Because prop drilling requires passing data through each intermediate component manually,  it can take more time and can introduce mistakes.

### A Solution to Prop Drilling - Context

- What is React Context?
    - [From the docs](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context#:~:text=Context%20lets%20the%20parent%20component%20make%20some%20information%20available%20to%20any%20component%20in%20the%20tree%20below%20it%E2%80%94no%20matter%20how%20deep%E2%80%94without%20passing%20it%20explicitly%20through%20props.)
        - *Context* lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below itâ€”no matter how deepâ€”without passing it explicitly through props.
    - In other words:
        - Context is a way to share state between unrelated or distant components.
            - Think of React Context as a shared container that holds some data.
            - This data can be accessed by any component that needs it, regardless of how nested the component is in the component tree.
    - **Context solves the prop drilling problem**

### Break ðŸ˜´

### Updating Context

- **In the prop drilling example:**
    - We used a state setter function to update the state when the user clicked the button in the Child component.
    - We can add this functionality back into the app by moving the Provider into the App component.
    - This would give us access to the state variable and setter function.

### Abstracting The Context Provider

- create a provider component in the CreatedContext file that uses the CreatedContext.Provider and wrap the app or grandparent component.
